# Inspiration
As a team of developers interested in educational technology, we wanted to create a platform that was not only fun and engaging for all ages, but also provided more advanced tools for older users. We were inspired by the simplicity and ease of use of Scratch, but wanted to add more features and customization options to make it even more useful.

# What it does
PyScratch is a Scratch-like platform that allows users to easily create interactive projects and games with visual coding blocks. In addition to the standard Scratch blocks, we added custom blocks that did more productive tasks for the older generation such as web scraping, auto-clicking, and more. This makes PyScratch an ideal tool for hobbyists, educators, and professionals alike.

# How we built it
PyScratch is built using Google's Blockly infrastructure, with additional custom blocks added by our team. We used a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build the frontend, with Flask as our backend framework. We also integrated various APIs and libraries, such as Selenium for web scraping and auto-clicking.

# Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was adding custom blocks to the platform. We had to dive deep into the Blockly documentation and experiment with different approaches before we found a solution that worked. Additionally, we had to make sure that the platform was user-friendly and accessible to people of all ages and technical backgrounds.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of the fact that we were able to create a platform that combines the simplicity and ease of use of Scratch with more advanced features for older users. We're also proud of the custom blocks we added, which we believe make PyScratch more useful and versatile than other Scratch-like platforms.

# What we learned
Throughout the development process, we learned a lot about JavaScript, Flask, and various APIs and libraries. We also learned a lot about user interface design and accessibility, which we believe will help us create better products in the future.

# What's next for PyScratch
We plan to continue adding more custom blocks and features to PyScratch to make it even more useful for all users. Additionally, we're exploring the possibility of integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence tools into the platform, which we believe would take PyScratch to the next level. Overall, we're excited to see how PyScratch will evolve and grow in the future.
